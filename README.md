# NaiveBayesTwitter-2016
<h3>Created at Coe College in 2016</h3>
<p>Used during the 2016 election to predict the votes of Twitter users. Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to link words commonly used by both candidates and their parties to voting habits. </p>
<p>In the end, the Naive Bayes approach as implemented here was only slightly more accurate than flipping a coin, even with groups of up to n words added to the classifier.</p>
<p>Requires Twython, as well as valid Twitter keys to access the Twitter API. Some accounts listed in the  accounts.txt may no longer be up, and certainly some are no longer in office.</p>
<p>Main files are Twitter.py to get the words for listed accounts, then Spammy.py to classify accounts.</p>
